This is an example of application written with the backbone.js
framework, demonstrating a variant of the MVC pattern.
This introduces the concept of separating View and Controller with
backbone.

The application itself simply allows edits of the content of
any paragraph, and persists the edits in backbone models.
The edits will be reapplied when the app is reloaded.

TODO:
 - Create edit form for paragraph content.
 - Use LocalStorage backend for persistence.
